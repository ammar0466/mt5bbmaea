# BBMA Reentry Reference

## Definition
Reentry in BBMA OA is:
- A structure for entry/open position
- Also called "entry zone"
- Usually occurs after CSAK and candlestick momentum
- Not always at MAHILOW level

## Types of Reentry

### 1. MAHILOW Reentry
- Most basic reentry taught by Oma Ally
- High winrate
- Can yield hundreds of pips
- Must occur after momentum or CSAK

### 2. EMA 50 Reentry
- Occurs when MAHILOW touches EMA 50
- High accuracy
- Popular among BBMA traders
- Visual confirmation through MAHILOW-EMA 50 touch

### 3. Mid BB Reentry
- MAHILOW touches middle Bollinger Band
- Common near end of trend
- Can also occur at trend start
- Requires proper validation

## Candlestick Patterns at Reentry

### 1. Pinbar
- Long shadow, small body
- Indicates lack of strength in opposite direction
- Good for single timeframe analysis

### 2. Doji
- Equal upper and lower shadows
- Small body
- Shows price indecision
- Valid if followed by candle in reentry direction

### 3. Engulfing
- Second candle completely engulfs first candle
- Indicates loss of momentum
- Price likely to follow reentry direction

## Validation Process (RESMO - Reentry after Momentum)

### Timeframe Analysis
1. First Timeframe (H4)
   - Must have full BBMA structure
   - Clear trend direction
   - Previous structure before reentry

2. Second Timeframe (H1)
   - Look for extreme formation
   - Check structure before extreme
   - Momentum sell confirms reentry

3. Third Timeframe (M15)
   - Focus on entry execution
   - Full structure required
   - Extreme or MHV needed
   - Wait for momentum formation

## Key Points
1. Reentry must not be broken by price
2. Multi-timeframe analysis is crucial
3. Full structure before reentry indicates quality
4. Proper validation reduces false signals
5. Structure quality determines reentry quality

## Best Practices
1. Always check multiple timeframes
2. Validate reentry with proper structure
3. Wait for full setup before entry
4. Use candlestick patterns as additional confirmation
5. Focus on structure quality over just pattern recognition

## Common Mistakes
1. Entering without proper structure
2. Ignoring multi-timeframe validation
3. Not waiting for full setup
4. Trading against trend direction
5. Ignoring previous structure quality
