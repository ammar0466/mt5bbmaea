# BBMA Reentry After Momentum Reference

## Definition
Reentry after momentum (RESMO) is:
- An entry zone that occurs after momentum
- A continuation entry or trend continuation
- One of the best entry types in BBMA trading
- Requires understanding of both momentum and reentry structures

## Functions of Momentum in Market
1. Signal Function (Higher Timeframe)
   - Occurs in first timeframe (H4 and above)
   - Acts as a signal
   - Entry waits for price to enter reentry setup

2. Entry Confirmation (Lower Timeframe)
   - Occurs in third timeframe
   - Confirms valid entry
   - Entry can be executed after momentum forms

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
### Timeframe Requirements
1. First Timeframe (H4+)
   - RESMO (Reentry after momentum)
   - Must be H4 or higher
   - Validates overall setup

2. Second Timeframe
   - Must show Extreme formation
   - Confirms first timeframe reentry
   - EMA 100 used as SL reference

3. Third Timeframe
   - Full Structure (FS) required
   - Entry execution timeframe
   - Minimizes SL distance
   - Maximizes profit potential

### Entry Codes
- R-E-E (Reentry | Extreme | Extreme)
- R-E-M (Reentry | Extreme | MHV)

## Entry Process
1. First Timeframe Validation
   - Look for reentry after momentum
   - Three consecutive candlesticks breaking band
   - Confirms strong momentum
   - Coded as "R" (reentry)

2. Second Timeframe Confirmation
   - Clear extreme formation
   - EMA 100 as SL reference
   - Validates first timeframe setup
   - Coded as "E" (extreme)

3. Third Timeframe Entry
   - Full structure present
   - Entry execution
   - Minimal SL distance
   - Early entry for maximum profit
   - Coded as "E" or "M"

## Best Practices
1. Start with H4 timeframe
2. Follow SOP strictly
3. Backtest extensively (500+ entries)
4. Maintain discipline in setup application
5. Focus on visual setup recognition
6. Progress from swing to scalping

## Example Case: XAUUSD H1
1. First Timeframe (H1)
   - Three candlesticks break lower band
   - Strong momentum confirmation
   - Clear reentry setup

2. Second Timeframe
   - Clear extreme formation
   - EMA 100 as SL reference
   - Validates H1 reentry

3. Third Timeframe
   - Full structure present
   - Entry with 1:1 RR
   - Result: 69 pips profit
   - Maximum drawdown: 15 pips

## Key Points
1. Multi-timeframe validation is crucial
2. Momentum quality determines setup strength

4. Proper structure sequence is essential
5. Visual recognition improves with practice

## Common Mistakes
1. Single timeframe analysis
2. Ignoring momentum quality

5. Rushing to scalping without mastery

## Learning Progression
1. Start with H4 timeframe
2. Master visual setup recognition
3. Practice holding for hundreds of pips
