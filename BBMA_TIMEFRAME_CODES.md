# BBMA Timeframe Codes

## Overview
BBMA uses specific codes to identify pattern sequences across multiple timeframes. The sequence flows from higher to lower timeframes (H4 → H1 → M15).

## Code Definitions

### 1. REE (Reentry → Extreme → Extreme)
```
First Letter (R):  H4 - Reentry
Second Letter (E): H1 - Extreme
Third Letter (E):  M15 - Extreme
```
- H4: Reentry formation
- H1: Extreme formation
- M15: Extreme formation

### 2. REM (Reentry → Extreme → MHV)
```
First Letter (R):  H4 - Reentry
Second Letter (E): H1 - Extreme
Third Letter (M):  M15 - MHV
```
- H4: Reentry formation
- H1: Extreme formation
- M15: MHV formation

### 3. RRE (Reentry → Reentry → Extreme)
```
First Letter (R):  H4 - Reentry
Second Letter (R): H1 - Reentry
Third Letter (E):  M15 - Extreme
```
- H4: Reentry formation
- H1: Reentry formation
- M15: Extreme formation

## Key Points
- Each code represents a specific sequence of patterns
- Must validate in order from higher to lower timeframe
- Higher timeframe patterns carry more weight
- Used to confirm trade setups across multiple timeframes
- Helps filter out false signals

## Pattern Sequence
1. Higher timeframe (H4) forms first pattern
2. Wait for middle timeframe (H1) to form its pattern
3. Wait for lower timeframe (M15) to form its pattern
4. Only enter when all patterns align in sequence

## Example with REE
1. Wait for Reentry on H4
2. Once H4 Reentry forms, wait for Extreme on H1
3. Once H1 Extreme forms, wait for Extreme on M15
4. Enter trade when M15 Extreme forms
