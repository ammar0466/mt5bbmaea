# BBMA Extreme Entry Reference

## Definition
Extreme in BBMA OA is:
- A structure indicating trend end in the market
- Clearly visible when MAHI or MALOW exits Bollinger Band
- Starting point of BBMA structure
- Has evolved with additional forms for analysis

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Requirements
1. Must have candlestick patterns:
   - Pinbar
   - Engulfing
2. Must be on H4 timeframe or higher
3. Entry point after pattern formation

## Entry Methods

### 1. Single Timeframe Entry
- Enter immediately when extreme engulfing forms
- No additional confirmation needed
- Higher risk, faster entry
- Best when pattern is clear and strong

### 2. Multi-timeframe Entry
- First timeframe (H4): Extreme engulfing
- Second timeframe (H1): Must form extreme
- Third timeframe (M15): Must form extreme
- Must show momentum on third timeframe
- Lower risk, more confirmation

## Special Cases

### 1. EMA 50 Rejection
- Extreme engulfing stopped by EMA 50
- Confirms reentry on higher timeframe
- Very high probability setup
- Best for immediate entry

### 2. Full Structure Entry
- Extreme forms after reentry structure
- Higher probability setup
- More reliable for entry
- Better risk management

## Best Practices
1. Always check for candlestick patterns
2. Prefer H4 timeframe or higher
